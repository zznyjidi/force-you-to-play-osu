# Force You to Play Osu!

A script that automatically download and open osu! But you can't close it. (Kind of)

# How to Use

Release version is a helper that will download the actual payload version and register it to start at boot for current user.  
Payload version is the underlaying program that installs osu! and detect if it is running

# How to Remove

If you used any of the helper/script to install, all the files will be saved to your user's home directory, just kill payload.exe in task manager and remove the payload files.
- payload.exe
- payload.build
- payload.onefile-build
- payload.dist
- payload.zip

And If osu! is installed with the payload, there will be a install.exe at the same folder. It is the installer for osu!lazer.
